 * Range checking is broken, reserving 2M and offering 3M binary data

 * doc/ directory contains a file which refers images from /home/frank/
   - please fix this or remove the whole doc/ altogether.
 * the scripts/ directory should live in mit-utils/tests/ubi-tests/scripts
   and it would be nice to have a short description of the tests
