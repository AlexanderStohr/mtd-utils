This directory contains various stuff that has to be cleaned up and sorted out.

* jffs2_test.sh: this has nothing to do to UBI. And the test is quite trivial,
  so it is questionable if it should not be deleted. Anyway, if we want this,
  it has to be moved to mtd-utils.git/tests/fs-tests.

* ubigen.c: this utility adds UBI headers to an image file, but does not
  generate the volume table. It is probably useless, but one might find it
  interesting, so we do not drop it so far and keep here.

* bin2nand2bin_test.sh: tests nand2bin and bin2nand utilities. Should probably
  go to some tests/tools-tests or something. the nand2bin and bin2nand
  utilities themselves have nothing to do to UBI in general and should not sit
  in ubi-utils. Should be moved somewhere like mtd-utils.git/nand-tools/

* f64_nor_sample.cfg, f128_nand_sample.cfg: just exampe of configuration files
  for the mkpfi utility. Not too useful without any documentation. Some pfi
  configuration file format documentation has to be added to mkpfi man page and
  these files should probably be added there.

* pdd.txt: not sure what is it, this is probably something specific to the
  setup which is used by IBM guys (Frank, Andreas, Josh). This is probably not
  of general interest and should go away.

* run_all.sh: runns "all" test.

* ubicrc32.pl: probably redundand as we already have a C ubicrc32 utility.

* ubi_test.sh: some UBI testing script, should go to
  mtd-utils.git/tests/ubi-tests.

* unubi_test.sh: tests the "unubi" utility, should go somewhere like
  tests/tools-tests

* inject_biterror.pl: injects a bit error to a binary image. Does not relate to
  UBI and should go to mtd-utils.git/nand-tools/ or something

* Makefile: previously was sitting at ubi-tools/scripts and prepared fake image
  files for test scripts.

* test.cfg: mkpfi configuration file for ubi_tools_test.sh

* ubi_tools_test.sh: similar to unubi_test.sh

* nand2bin.c, bin2nand.c: useful utilities which should go to
  mtd-utils.git/nand-tools/

* nandecc.c, nandecc.h: needed to compile nand2bin and bin2nand

* nandcorr.c: seems to be unused

* mkbootenv.c: no idea what is this about. Looks like something specific to IBM
  guys's setup.
