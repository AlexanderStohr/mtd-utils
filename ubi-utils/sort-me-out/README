This directory contains various stuff that has to be cleaned up and sorted out.

* jffs2_test.sh: this has nothing to do to UBI. And the test is quite trivial,
  so it is questionable if it should not be deleted. Anyway, if we want this,
  it has to be moved to mtd-utils.git/tests/fs-tests.

* ubigen.c: this utility adds UBI headers to an image file, but does not
  generate the volume table. It is probably useless, but one might find it
  interesting, so we do not drop it so far and keep here.
