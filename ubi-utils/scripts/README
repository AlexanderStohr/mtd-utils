This procedure creates a test pfi which should be flashed to our
system with pfiflash. The testcase should read the data back and 
compare with the original.

We should try not forget to run these tests before we release 
a new version of UBI.

Please guys, clean up this and move the tests to mtd-utils/tests/
Artem.
